# webpack3
Webpack 3 step by step set up along with babel and ReactJs.

## Purpose of this repo
To set up Webpack 3 along with Babel and React in a step by step fashion. 

**Motivation:**
There are a ton of good online tutorials and guides on how to configure Webpack but unfortunately most of them focus on specific Technology Stacks  which leave us with a final hugue package.json and Webpack.config file which makes the idea of picking up the specific tasks that we want quite a challenge.

In this repo I will tackle one task at a time and have different branches for each one with a final Master branch joining all of them. So ideally you should be able to pick up only the functionality you need skipping unnecessary code to run via Webpack into your project. 


This branch keeps the initial minimum configuration to enable Webpack using Javascript files.
